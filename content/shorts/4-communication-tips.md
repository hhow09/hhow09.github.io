## Code review [^1]
1. Be kind.
2. Explain your reasoning.
3. Balance giving explicit directions with just pointing out problems and letting the developer decide.
4. Encourage developers to simplify code or add code comments instead of just explaining the complexity to you.
5. Label comment severity: e.g. nit, optional, fyi


## In Slack
1. When asking open questions / design decisions, create vote or clear options would get better response.
2. When thread becomes long, summarize the conclusion and action items.
